# lazy-todos
Here I'm playing around with ionic creating a todo list app in the style of a checklist.
Possible features:
- pre-inserted list of categories/todos
-Todo grouped into categories.
- user can add categories (saved into local storage)
- user can add todos
- icons next to categories
- checklist marker next to todos
- checklists are saved into session storage
